## About

Second-year **Computer Science & IT** student at the _University of Galway_ with experience in modern web development frameworks and full-stack applications. I got into web development through building a swimming monitoring system that interested me, and have since explored various technologies from React frontends to Node.js backends with custom authentication systems.

**Currently Working On:**

- Swimming Monitoring System with React and Node.js
- Managing Docker stacks for home server infrastructure
- Participated in a Game Jam with "Artificial" - exploring humanity's creations

**Learning:** PostgreSQL, React, Cloud deployment, Java
